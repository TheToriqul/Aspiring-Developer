   git clone https://github.com/TheToriqul/Aspiring-Developer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser on a large-screen device to view the website

## Usage

Navigate through the website sections using the menu. Explore the developer's journey, skills, and goals. Note that the site is optimized for viewing on large screens only.

## Customization

- To change the color scheme or layout, modify the styles in `style.css`.
- To update content, edit the text and image references in `index.html`.
- To change images, replace the files in the `assets` folder and update the `src` attributes in the HTML file.
- When customizing, remember that the design is intended for large screens only.

## Browser Compatibility

This website is designed for desktop or large devices only. It is compatible with modern web browsers, including:

- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize images for web to reduce load times.
- Minify CSS file for production.
- Consider lazy loading for images and embedded content.

## Testing

Manually test the website on various large-screen devices to ensure functionality and visual consistency. Focus on:

1. Desktop/large device views
2. Different screen resolutions within the large-screen category
3. Functionality of all interactive elements

## Deployment

To deploy using GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to the "Pages" section
3. Choose the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`)
4. Select the root folder as the source
5. Save the settings and wait for GitHub to deploy your site
6. After deployment, test on large-screen devices to ensure proper display

## Future Enhancements

- Implement responsive design for mobile and tablet devices (if desired in the future).
- Add a projects showcase section to display completed work.
- Integrate a blog for sharing learning experiences and tech insights.
- Implement form functionality for the support section.
- Utilize Tailwind CSS for more efficient styling.
